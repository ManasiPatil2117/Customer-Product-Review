Microphone is sooooo bad",N/A,"Sound quality, bass is good. But the only thing which is really frustrating is, the microphone is pretty damned up, it doesn't capture my voice properly even in a closed environment. Not at all good for travelling, if you think it has Ambient mode, don't fool yourself. Of course it does the job but when you travel on a bike or something the caller can't even hear a single word that you speak nor you can hear the caller speak through your buds because all you hear is the wind sound which are recorded by the external mics when you turn on 'Ambient mode'. There's only one 3rd party support who doesn't even reply to any queries or support through Email. So, I hope you think through this thoroughly before you buy it.Not worth the price. Go for a better one."

Issues with charging",N/A,Overall it's a good product but one point I'm not satisfied with is that one of the earbud terminal gets oxidised everytime I'm wearing it in gym because of sweating. It leads to non charging of earbud when I put it in charging case. I eventually found out a way by cleaning the terminal with alcoholic sanitiser with earbuds. It helps everytime but such issues are not expected from such a reputed company. I came to know that many people faced this same issue.

Long story short if u can get these at 5.5k these will be super worthy ‚úåÔ∏è",N/A,"Firstly these are good oneüòé, sound quality is clear and good but from Skullcandy I expected more on bass thing not on sound quality (Ofcource sounds quality is also required) these do have decent amount of bass but I expected more as these are Skullcandy's üòè and fit is amazing ü§©, battery life is good best part the case has battery life indicator ‚úåÔ∏è, extra fins are so helpful like in some situations we feel not to use as general buds may fall out but if u use these fins u fell like they are stuck in ur earsüòÖ but no matter how hard u shake ur head those do not come out with those fins on and I feel ambient mood is not good enough, definitely a little bigger in size these buds, hardware is good enough and finally at this price these are little prizyüòè may be like if they are down to 5.5k or 5k then these will be super worthy ‚úåÔ∏è, when am buying I compared with liberty soundcore air2 from youtube reviewers these soundcore are better but service wise Skullcandy are better in india so I went for Skullcandy one"

Waste of Money",N/A,"Don't buy these instead of these you can buy Sony or OnePlus earbuds.It doesn't have adequate sound quality as well as the microphone sensitivity Is very low, you can't even talk properly on a call using these.Not worth the money.."

Bit higher on price. But...",N/A,"Connectivity is fine as it is BT V4.1. They opted this only for using either of the buds individually. No IR which pauses media when you remove them. Instead, you can insert into the case to do so. Priced a bit higher than usual. But, you'll get what you need(Skullcandy is similar to Fastrack of watches). Connects instantly but struggles when you are behind a wall. Vocals are crisp and clear. Little less in bass(I like more vocals than bass). I bought these only for music while working out in the morning. You can find your fit with changeable ear buds and gels provided (1+3 pairs). If you usually change the drivers you use, this is definitely not for you. But, when i was buying nothing has battery life as it has. And, I am getting the battery life as promised. As of now, if you can spend more you get more options to make worth your bucks."

¬†Sound quality is excellent and the buds fit perfectly in your ear.But the charging capsules quality is piss poor. Magnetic closing mechanism is very poor and it feels cheap. Longevity is a question that should be asked. Pairing and range is very good."

Microphone is sooooo bad",N/A,"Sound quality, bass is good. But the only thing which is really frustrating is, the microphone is pretty damned up, it doesn't capture my voice properly even in a closed environment. Not at all good for travelling, if you think it has Ambient mode, don't fool yourself. Of course it does the job but when you travel on a bike or something the caller can't even hear a single word that you speak nor you can hear the caller speak through your buds because all you hear is the wind sound which are recorded by the external mics when you turn on 'Ambient mode'. There's only one 3rd party support who doesn't even reply to any queries or support through Email. So, I hope you think through this thoroughly before you buy it.Not worth the price. Go for a better one."

Issues with charging",N/A,Overall it's a good product but one point I'm not satisfied with is that one of the earbud terminal gets oxidised everytime I'm wearing it in gym because of sweating. It leads to non charging of earbud when I put it in charging case. I eventually found out a way by cleaning the terminal with alcoholic sanitiser with earbuds. It helps everytime but such issues are not expected from such a reputed company. I came to know that many people faced this same issue.

Long story short if u can get these at 5.5k these will be super worthy ‚úåÔ∏è",N/A,"Firstly these are good oneüòé, sound quality is clear and good but from Skullcandy I expected more on bass thing not on sound quality (Ofcource sounds quality is also required) these do have decent amount of bass but I expected more as these are Skullcandy's üòè and fit is amazing ü§©, battery life is good best part the case has battery life indicator ‚úåÔ∏è, extra fins are so helpful like in some situations we feel not to use as general buds may fall out but if u use these fins u fell like they are stuck in ur earsüòÖ but no matter how hard u shake ur head those do not come out with those fins on and I feel ambient mood is not good enough, definitely a little bigger in size these buds, hardware is good enough and finally at this price these are little prizyüòè may be like if they are down to 5.5k or 5k then these will be super worthy ‚úåÔ∏è, when am buying I compared with liberty soundcore air2 from youtube reviewers these soundcore are better but service wise Skullcandy are better in india so I went for Skullcandy one"

Waste of Money",N/A,"Don't buy these instead of these you can buy Sony or OnePlus earbuds.It doesn't have adequate sound quality as well as the microphone sensitivity Is very low, you can't even talk properly on a call using these.Not worth the money.."

Bit higher on price. But...",N/A,"Connectivity is fine as it is BT V4.1. They opted this only for using either of the buds individually. No IR which pauses media when you remove them. Instead, you can insert into the case to do so. Priced a bit higher than usual. But, you'll get what you need(Skullcandy is similar to Fastrack of watches). Connects instantly but struggles when you are behind a wall. Vocals are crisp and clear. Little less in bass(I like more vocals than bass). I bought these only for music while working out in the morning. You can find your fit with changeable ear buds and gels provided (1+3 pairs). If you usually change the drivers you use, this is definitely not for you. But, when i was buying nothing has battery life as it has. And, I am getting the battery life as promised. As of now, if you can spend more you get more options to make worth your bucks."

¬†Sound quality is excellent and the buds fit perfectly in your ear.But the charging capsules quality is piss poor. Magnetic closing mechanism is very poor and it feels cheap. Longevity is a question that should be asked. Pairing and range is very good."
