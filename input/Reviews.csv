"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."

"How am I supposed to fit this massive power adapter in my tiny power strip? The monitor I had previously used a regular power cord, the ones that can also be used to power your PC’s power supply. I’m not sure WHY this even exists. PLUS, it’s so SHORT. I’m lucky that I was barely able to make it work but what about someone else? In my case though, I did have to purchase a 1ft power extension cord which is RIDICULOUS because I already have ten different regular power cords I could’ve used.Anyway, the monitor works great. I like that I don’t need to adjust the resolution settings on Linux (i used on Windows too) and it auto-defaults to 1440p at 144hz. My other monitor would default to just 60hz even though it could do 144hz. The setup was relatively simple though I’ve had simpler. I also wished it was curved as my old one was curved but I purchased this without thinking too much about it because it was recommended to me by someone I knew. It felt like the edges were splaying outwards since I rarely ever used a flat monitor but I was able to get used to it.All in all, it works great. No defects or anything like that but I do wish with all the money I spent they used a standard power cord. The regular power cord is like the USB-C cable of the mobile cord. Making it proprietary just makes me wary of any future purchases of this brand."
"i just got back in to PC so i upgraded my old system. i was using an LG 24 monitor nothing special about it. so getting this beast was a major upgrade. right out of the box the base and stand are pretty heavy. def not cheaply built. the monitor itself also was heavy so put together this thing is hefty. plugged in and started immediately, no need to download any drivers. resolution auto set to 1440p and let me tell ya, WOW. opening chrome to a website and the page is more viewable compared to my 24in that was only 720p. for price point of $300, im not disappointed. i researched a lot of monitors both VA panel and IPS and this was the best choice i could have made. i did want 4k but most of those monitors were double the price and i would have to sacrifice refresh rates. if youre looking for a good size screen and vibrant image, this is your monitor."
"This monitor is everything I could hope for.  My older monitor was flickering frequently.  After trying a new GPU, new cable and new drivers I had no choice but to try a new monitor.  This LG was great out of the box.  I didn't need to adjust any settings though I did check them to ensure they were where I wanted them to be.  No flickering.  Native 144Mz refresh but no issues running the monitor at 120Mz which is what I prefer.  I am very pleased with this purchase."
"For the money, this gaming monitor is a excellent value. Sharp picture and very easy to set up. Use it on my ps4 playing grand turmiso sport."
"Este monitor lo voy a usar para gestionar colores en archivos de diseño, programar y jugar videojuegos, el problema es que ayer cuando lo instalé estuvo muy bien y funcionaba perfectamente pero hoy al encenderlo hubo un pixel muerto como muestro en la pantalla, si se pone la pantalla en negro se puede apreciar mejor, si bien no es algo muy grande para pedir una devolución o reembolso me gustaría saber si hay alguna forma para arreglar esto ya que puede afectar a mi comodidad con el monitor"

 This was worth every penny. I researched so many monitors. I wanted a 27in and a 144ghz. I looked at the PC part brands like MSI and gigabyte who often had dead pixel problems. I looked at ASUS and Acer and cheaper brands like AOC or Viotek. I also did research on LG screens and figured if phone companies and tv companies also use LG screens for their products than an LG monitor has to be a solid choice.I also needed something with multiple ports as I work from home and game and have to have multiple computers plugged into one monitor. I also REALLY liked the stand that this comes with. The bottom of the feet are grippy so it won’t slide around easily or scratch up your desk. The height adjustment on this thing beats out every other competition. Not only is it so easy to move it up and down it can also be turned vertically! My boyfriend bought the same monitor after me and the weird clip on handle in the back doesn’t fit properly but it’s not even needed to be used. You just very slightly squeeze is and it’ll lower. Otherwise going up you just lift the screen like magic. So easy a baby could do it and it’s also a fun brag factor when your friends come over!We have a 3070 GPU so we wanted a monitor that would go hand in hand with it. So far it’s been wonderful. You can really change the settings on it just through the monitor but you can even further tweak everything through the NVIDIA g-sync which is FANTASTIC!!!!!!BE AWARE!!!!! I do however want to !!WARN!! Everyone about one thing: we downloaded the LG driver for the monitor (which basically does the same thing the actual monitor button does but we were curious....) but we turned on HDR through that and it basically crashed our computers. Everytime I opened a game in full screen it would completely freeze my PC and I would have to restart it. I uninstalled the program and it still was crashing. (My bf uninstalled his and it worked fine after) I was freaking out. I went into the monitor button settings and just reset settings to factory and it fixed everything. So I’m not exactly sure what the issue is with that drive but I would NOT download it! I since have turned HDR on again through the monitor button settings and it’s fine so it was something with that driver.A 1440p and 144ghz monitor looks amazing we had fun watching YouTube videos to see the detail and colors of it. However the Home Screen was so tiny everything from the menu bar to the programs on the desktop were super tiny. Down to the font size on browsers so I adjusted my settings to make everything 110% zoom which makes my monitor look “normal” again. Otherwise those are the only settings I’ve really had to change on this monitor. I know other non ISP monitors you have to change color shading and everything to make it look good which is why I went with an IPS monitor. Also leave it on fast mode dont move it to faster ever unless you like shadowing.So far I have zero complaints. No dead pixels. Amazing build quality. Monitor feels solid and light. Easy to adjust height and vertical. Base is ingenuity. The size is perfect. It’s not curved. The settings in the monitor buttons are perfect and plenty. G-sync is fantastic. HDR looks amazing freesync works great.I also want to mention in game mode there’s a reader option which makes working from home even better. Not sure what the effect does specifically but it makes words softer on the eyes if your reading or working from home which I LOVE!Although the stand it comes with is amazing: what gamer doesn’t get a VIVO mount? This stand slides off really easy in order to mount it I was surprised again LG out did themselves on this monitor! Buy it!"
"I'm not going into detail on the picture quality, there are a ton of reviews out there for that.  Suffice it to say it is very sharp for gaming, coding and office work.  My goal is just to share a few observations to help future buyers.  First, if you use the HDMI cable you will be capped at 100Hz refresh rate.  Also, Nvida doesn't detect g-sync unless you use the DisplayPort cable.  Secondly, the cables are only 4ft.  Come on LG, that wasn't enough to route to my dual monitor arms.  And, thirdly, is the issue with the VESA mount being recessed.  I have a standard gas spring dual monitor mount with 100mmx100mm.  My VESA mounting plate was too large to fit into the monitor without some power tool mods wth an angle grinder.  LG could have mitigated this by making the screw holes flush on the back or increase the dimensions of the recessed box to more generous levels.  I almost returned because of this, but I really want to keep the monitor so I made it work.  That might be beyond the scope for some so be aware."
"Nice panels, thin bezels. Good monitors for the price, but there were some unexpected quirks that presented some inconvenience and required additional equipment for a workaround:1) Jankiest power supply design imaginable (cumbersome brick + short cable)The power bricks can only be plugged in vertically in one direction and block any opposing outlet (both vertically AND horizontally). It'd be impossible to plug two of these into a standard 2-plug wall outlet and, as an added bonus, the cable is comically short and will point downward (unless you're using a power strip so you can flip it) so it'll have extra travel distance.To be fair, if you're buying a 1440p monitor, you should at least be familiar with the concept of a power strip (ideally with a UPS behind it). Still, I'd suggest looking into ones that can be oriented to account for cumbersome plugs like this so you don't end up with 2+ unusable outlets.Also note the cable length - my setup required mounting the strip under the desk right below the monitors in order for the cable to reach them both, and it still left very little leeway for cable management.2) Monitors and power brick get quite warmThey get noticeably warmer than any other monitors I've had. The ambient heat output is non-trivial.Note I am coming from two 1080p BenQ monitors and these are the first/only 1440p panels I have owned, so I may just be out of reference here."
