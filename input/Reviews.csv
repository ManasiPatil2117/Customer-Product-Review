"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."

According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case.

"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."

And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information.

I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number.

I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch.

I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1.

I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."

My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings.

It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in.

When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"

My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."

According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
"Unfortunately, my experience with the LG monitor was far from what I expected. I purchased this as a special gift for my little sister, hoping to add joy to our holiday celebrations. However, upon arrival, the monitor was defective. This unexpected flaw cast a shadow over our holiday festivities, causing immense disappointment.While I cannot comment on the monitor’s functionality due to the defect (white horizontal lines at the bottom part of display - 50% of it was in lines), the overall experience was deeply disappointing. I sincerely hope that LG can improve their quality control measures to prevent such incidents from affecting other customers. As a buyer, trust and quality are paramount, especially during special occasions.Despite this unfortunate experience, I remain hopeful that LG will address these issues promptly to ensure a better experience for future customers"
"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case.

"I have a 32 inch, 60hz Samsung that I bought a couple of years ago which has worked fine but it always seemed a bit big to me.  I've started gaming on my computer a lot more and decided now would be a good time to go back down to a 27 inch monitor and get something better suited for FPS games at the same time.After I swapped this in I thought I must have done something wrong.* The picture looked like it had way too much contrast, making photo-realistic games look almost cartoonish.* The brightness also hurt my eyes (during the day) so I turned that way down but then it was too dim in low light game environments.* 144hz only comes through a DP cable.  My fault for not knowing this I guess and wasn't a big deal once I figured it out but make sure your video card as a DP port.  Mine did and this comes with a DP cable so ended up working out.* None of the various modes really produced what felt like a ""normal"" picture.  They were all either too bright, saturated, faded, etc.After fiddling with it for a couple hours I concluded this was just what I was going to get out of it.  I did spend a night gaming on it and it worked okay but I didn't find it much of an improvement over my old monitor and afterwards my eyes felt really strained.  Maybe that was just an adjustment but kind of a red flag for me.  The last straw was the next when I sat down to get some work done (I'm a software developer) and all text looked terrible.  Email, code, terminal, browser, everything.  It physically hurt my eyes to look at it.  At that point I just swapped my old monitor back in and don't miss the higher refresh rate at all.If your only use is for gaming this might work for you (but I didn't notice any improvement going from 60 to 144 hz).  If you plan to do work on this I strongly suggest looking elsewhere."
"I developed an eye twitch after using this monitor for work. I had used it for under a year before developing a twitch. I tried all of the different recommendations from doctors to try and fix my eye twitch. I reduced screen time, took frequent breaks, quit caffeine, used night light mode in Windows, used blue light blocking glasses, took magnesium and potassium supplements etc... Nothing really worked. I had a twitch that would be active most of my waking hours. It was like a buzz, just totally constant. Finally I just unplugged the monitor and started using my old Asus VG248QE. Within two days the eye twitch was mostly resolved... Something is off with the LG IPS panels. Might have just been my unit. I'm going to stick with other brands and non-IPS panel types just to be super cautious. OLED and VA are both better than IPS anyway. Even my old TN that I started used again has better light distribution than the 27GL83A-B. Other than that, the picture quality was good. The 27GL83A-B wasn't as responsive as the VG248QE. If you only use the monitor for a couple hours per day then it's probably fine."
"First time buying pc monitor for gaming. I don't know if it is a good model, as soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it had signs of having been opened before and had been resealed. The monitor appears used/tampered with. It had no screen protector on the screen or anything to protect it. Returned immediately and I will try to order another one."
"Had two of these monitors for 3years now. If you want to buy two of these, make sure to buy at the same time, even if you're buying from this exact same link with that exact same model # the monitors could be different like mine. Bought mine i think one year apart, on the back it shows the same model #, same specs but different UI, colors, and size (off by like 1/6inch).Also you might run into a glitch like mine, both my monitors all of a sudden stopped outputting 1440p resolution at 144hz. Now I'm stuck at 1440p at 60hz. Literally tried everything, switching out the hdmi cables, reinstalling the drivers, resetting the monitors to factory settings. My old laptop had a GTX 1070, tried using it on my new laptop with RTX 3060 and still didn't work, but guess what? With the laptop RTX 3060 the monitors support 4k resolution at 60Hz. So beware, this may bug out on you.Update: Now one of them is broken"
"I currently use 4 LG monitors because they make fantastic panels. Unfortunately, they also sometimes make TERRIBLE decisions regarding firmware and monitor hardware, because this specific model has a major issue that makes it nearly unusable on multi-monitor setups.As has probably been mentioned elsewhere, when this monitor goes to sleep, it will act as though it was unplugged, and both move windows around at random when turned back on, as well as often causing the system to be unusable for up to a minute as the GPU figures out what's going on with this ""new monitor"". This happens every single time the monitor is turned off and means constant moving of windows and annoyance.If it weren't for this issue, the monitor would be a 5 star. I have an LG 27GL850 (this exact monitor, but with a built in USB hub) and it does not have this issue, and it's a 5/5. I have 2 LG 34WN80C-B that also don't have this issue, and I absolutely love them. I even bought a 27GP850 to replace this monitor after returning it, and so far it doesn't seem to have the same issue.If LG cared to fix their monitor firmware, this could be a great option, but unfortunately it is basically unusable unless you only plan on ever using this one monitor."
"Big fat dead pixel staring at me right in the center of the monitor on first power on. Can't say I'm surprised, given that every single LG product I've bought has had some quality control issue or another. At least I can say this'll be my last LG purchase for the rest of my life."
"The monitor broke after 2 days of use. It now flickers every 6.5 seconds. I swapped cables and ports. No avail. Plugged different computers into it. Same result. So I submitted an online support ticket to LG.Let me say this: bad things happen. I’m not overly irritated the monitor broke. No production process is flawless and duds will happen. My concern is LG’s support process.I received it on Friday. It started malfunctioning on Sunday.I submitted the online support request Sunday night and received an automated email almost immediately. The closing line is “We will call you as soon as possible.” Note that word: “call.”Monday I received an email from “Arianne” reiterating the ticket number, informing me to look for additional correspondence with shipping labels, offering condolences, and providing links to create support requests. As an IT professional, I hate these emails. All of that could have been accomplished in the automated response. Additionally, since I have created the ticket which kicked off this process, I don’t need instructions or links to accomplish what I’ve already successfully done. These emails are designed to placate the individual and provide a “human touch.” I find them condescending and superfluous.Tuesday night I received the shipping label and instructions to arrange a FedEx pick up.FedEx picked up the monitor Saturday.Keep in mind, it has now been 7 days and there has been no mention of when I will receive a replacement, and no actual contact with any support professional, no troubleshooting, and no “call.”So I called them.I asked for an estimate on when I can expect a replacement. I am informed that it is under warranty (duh, it broke after 2 days). But the warranty is a repair or replace warranty. So they have 10 business days from the time they receive it to attempt repairs. It could take as little as a “couple of days” if it’s an easy fix. If they determine it’s not repairable or cost effective to repair, I will receive a replacement or a refund. I am also told to allow 3-4 days shipping each way. For those keeping count, that means 3-4 days to them, 10 business days for assessment and repair (which will include at least 1 weekend), and 3-4 days return trip. I paid for a monitor, got 2 days of use out of it, and won’t have it back in working fashion for up to 20 days if all goes well. If all does not go well, I will wait a full month for a monitor I already paid for, and then be given a refund, purchase a replacement, wait another week for delivery, and hope this process does not repeat.When I spend a few hundred dollars on something, I expect it to work. If it happens to be faulty, I expect a PROMPT replacement. Nothing about this has been prompt thus far, and they are promising more of the same. And don’t tell me you’re going to call and then make me have to reach out to you a full week later.At this point I hope it becomes a refund scenario because I am not overjoyed at the prospect of doing business with LG in the future.**First update**Last week I called LG support again since they still seem unable to contact me and provide any guidance or information. I was told the monitor was still in transit.**Second update**It is now May 17th (14 days since I submitted the support request)I called the support number to day for an update. The support person tells me the repair team has not received the monitor yet, but he will follow up and have someone contact me. He advises me to expect a phone call and that I should ""keep my line clear."" He also took down my email address because they will send out ""periodic updates of repair progress."" That part is concerning since that information is already in the system with the repair tick (what they refer to as an RNN number). I have not received any call or email yet. Meanwhile, my repair status is still ""Appointment Confirmation"" which is the same status it has been in since I submitted the request 2 weeks ago.**Third Update**It's May 31st. They still list my monitor as being in repair status. Since my last update I have had contact with them twice. The first was when they called me to due to me filing a complaint on their website. All that person did was reiterate this is their standard support process. He took down my number and email address and informed me they would update me periodically throughout the process. To date, that call is the only contact they have initiated. I have received no updates in any format without reaching out to them myself. I called them again on the 26th to get a progress update and spoke to someone who told me it had not yet been repaired and parts had been ordered. He told me to expect the monitor between the 27th and the 31st. Seeing as how the ticket shows it still hasn't been repaired (and the date of this update), we can all guess how accurate that information was.**Fourth Update**June 1st.  It has now been 29 days since the support request was submitted.I called again today since yesterday was the deadline for  them to complete repair, replacement, or refund. I am being told the repair facility is waiting on parts which will not be available until next week. I requested they escalate the call to a manager since they are now in violation of their own terms, which they have explained to me each time I have reached out for updates. The response I was given is that they will transfer the call but I will be provided the same information. I reiterate they are past their own deadline and this is unacceptable. I clearly state there needs to be a resolution today and I need to be transferred to someone who can make that happen. He says please hold. I have been on hold for half an hour.**Fifth Update**June 1st update part 2. After being on hold for just over an hour, I spoke to a woman who explained the following to me:1. They should have never given me turnaround times. They are not supposed to set those expectations because they cannot guarantee them.2. She will initiate the refund/replacement process for me, but can't do it herself. She has to send an email to the repair department (Elizabeth) because they are the only ones who can initiate a replacement or refund request. She will send the email off instructing (asking?) them to initiate a replacement or refund request and call me back in ""a few days"" to ""let me know what they say.""3. The parts needed to repair my monitor are on back order.So for those keeping score, I am still losing. My current status is that the department that has failed me repeatedly are apparently the only ones who can resolve the issue. I should basically just kiss my $406.59 goodbye. I have utilized the ""Email the President"" feature on the LG website but I am not holding my breath. In short, while I like LG products and have purchased numerous over the years, their support system is the worst I have ever encountered and I will not purchase any of their products in the future.**Sixth Update**June 8th. No one ever called me back as promised back on June 1st. The monitor simply showed up at my door yesterday (not a replacement or refund as indicated on the 1st, but the original monitor...supposedly repaired). I bit my tongue and set it up. It seemed to work fine last night. This morning, however, it is back to flickering...but now every 3 seconds. So the monitor is worse than when I sent it in. I called LG support and they said in this scenario they would ask that I send the monitor back to them for additional repairs. I refused and said I want my money back. Now I'm on hold again to speak with someone from ""executive support.""**7th Update**After speaking with ""executive support"" on the 8th, I was told they were going to submit a request for a refund and someone would call me back on the 10th or 11th. It is now the 14th and I have heard nothing, so I called LG support again and was immediately informed by the gentleman who answered the phone that no request has been processed. So I'm on hold (again) for ""executive support."" This has moved from agonizingly frustrating to downright unacceptable and bordering on theft.**8th update**After a brief hold I spoke to a woman who said she needed to put me on hold to track down a co-worker (presumably the guy I spoke to last week). 5 minutes later she came back on the line and gave the same initial greeting. I told her I was still waiting for her to track down the co-worker and she hung up on me.**9th Update**Called back and spoke to someone from the executive support/services team who says the following:1. The refund request was not submitted last week because their is a chance it could get rejected. So I have been waiting for a week on a callback to update me on the status of something they never actually did.2. Their policy is that they get TWO repair chances before a refund can be considered.3. They can submit the refund request but there is a chance it could get rejected because I have not allowed them a second chance at repairs.As of this writing, I have reached out to them twice via the message the president feature (which I received only one response to). That person said they were my case manager and I haven't heard from them since. I have reached out via Twitter with no response yet. I have tracked them down by phone on a regular basis because no one ever follows up as they promise. And now I know they don't call me back because they don't take the actions they tell me they will, and if I don't call them I'll never know that I'm sitting with a broken monitor that no one wants to deal with.This is not ""customer support.""**10th update**Charlie from LG is now my case manager. According to him, the refund request has been submitted which goes to someone higher up for review. That takes 7-10 business days (sound familiar?). If it is approved, I can expect a refund in 4-6 weeks (mid August). If it is rejected, I have to send the monitor in again, and if all works as it previously did, I'll get it back sometime in mid August...and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.So lose/lose.**11th update**June 26th.Yesterday (the 25th) was the 10th business day (7-10 business days to review a refund request). I reached out to Charlie by responding to the text message he sent me on the 14th. Here is Charlie's original text to me:""This is Charlie from LG following up with you regarding your case. I will be your case manager until this is resolved. I will be sending you updates on your case. You do not need to call into customer service. Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns and I will respond promptly.""Is anyone surprised I have received no updates regarding my case? Is anyone surprised that I got no response to my inquiry yesterday? Me neither.The saga continues.**12th update**July 26thHaven't updated this in a while because, frankly, I just thought I was over it. Turns out, I'm not.My refund request was denied because I have to give them two repair attempts. So I sent it back.It arrived on my doorstep today. No updates or notifications since I sent it back to them, and the case tracker says repairs haven't even been started. But it's on my doorstep...with no power cable.I called in and explained the issue. I got put on hold while the rep ""went off to see what he can find out."" He came back and told me he sent this to someone above him and that person will review and get back to me. I asked for an ETA. He said he can't tell me ""when they will have time to reach out."" I told him that was unacceptable and he hung up on me.**13th update**July 30thSo I spent two days calling the executive management hotline and they are apparently no longer taking my calls. I pulled the number for the repair facility off some shipping labels and called them (NOT LG by the way...they outsource repairs). That rep told me they had a ticket for me to return the monitor for a third attempt at repairs. I explained that it was returned to me without a power cable, and that I did not know if it needed repairs because I cannot plug it in to check. She then closed the return request and arranged to ship me a power cable. Today I received a text message from the Executive Support number. It states: ""Our service records show that you recently spoke directly with an LG Presidential Liaison, is that correct? Please kindly select a number to let us know. 1) Yes 2) No"" I have NOT spoken to any presidential liaison and responded accordingly. I have no idea at this point what that question and response will or won't lead to. The power cable arrived today, and at this point it appears the monitor may be functioning properly. I'll leave it running and reverify tomorrow since the issue has never presented immediately.At this point I should mention the guy who hung up on me on the 26th told me, ""sir, we are doing our best to help you.""I really hope my experience is NOT what LG considers to be their best.**14th Update**August 6thI can now confirm the monitor is finally working. I have been using it for just over a week now and the flickering has not returned. There has been no contact from LG since they sent the missing power cable, and no follow-up to the previously mentioned text wherein they were ""confirming"" I had spoken to some mystery liaison (which never happened). And to be blunt, I am not calling to let them know they finally fixed it because, as I think we all can agree, they don't really care.So, in summary, beware of LG support. It took over 3 months and ridiculous amounts of frustration to get a broken device repaired.Toodles."
"I first purchased this back in October 2021 and got a model with minimum backlight bleed. Ran great, looked great....Recently it my experience changed when all of these features started to cause flickering, and signal loss.-144hz (Had to use 120 or would get flickering and signal loss)-Gsync (Completely unusable or would cause flickering and signal loss)After a week of experiencing these issues, and working around it, turning off the advertised features, the entire display became unusable even on desktop. I have troubleshooted for hours, trying different desktops (bios screens would flicker too) different cables, etc. No solution - hardware is borked.These issues started to happen in September 2023 after about 6,000 screen time hours.(outside of warranty - go figure)I was frustrated, because I still have displays running after 10 years (I don't expect all displays to run for that long - but October 2021 to September 2023 is horrible for $300)Even after experiencing all of these issues... I PURCHASED A REPLACEMENT.Replacement works fine, colors are good, advertised features are working (as of first day of use, will update this if anything changes) but this panel has significantly more backlight bleed.Some backlight bleed is to be expected as this is an IPS panel. My paid for replacement's backlight bleed however is noticeable enough to be disappointing and contributes to why I CANNOT recommend this monitor anymore. (IPS lottery is skewing this review, but its after having $300 fail in just under 2 years of use)If this monitor is COMFORTABLY within your budget, I would say give it a try - It has great colors, 1440p is enough of a difference from 1080p to get more screen real estate and sharper picture. IPS produces very nice colors. 144hz should be a standard for all gaming monitors at this point.but to someone who is looking for something that can be relied upon for years of use.... maybe look for a different monitor. Its a shame because this panel has great features, and I loved it enough to gamble on replacing it, but got a subpar panel in relative to what I had before. Its literally not worth returning and trying again just to maybe get something that will have to be replaced in a few years due to a failure.Other poorly rated reviews have mentioned similar issues happening outside of warranty, and for $300 something failing this soon is no good. Potential QA issues... LG almost have a winner, but it doesn't matter if it prematurely fails. Very sad to write this review"
"Received monitor in a timely fashion, but it doesnt work as advertised. Claims to work at 144hz refresh rate, but glitches out with green/white/blue lines across the screen when running at 144hz. The screen will also go blank for as little as 3 seconds to up to 30 seconds making games unplayable when it occurs. When switching down to 120hz cap on refresh rate, monitor works fine, but that isn't what I purchased the screen for. Wanted to get a replacement through Amazon but they refused to give me a replacement, only offered to refund me which I did not want a refund since I got the monitor on a discounted deal. Now I am trying to get LG to repair the monitor but they aren't capable of sending a shipping label to my email when they say I should be receiving it. I am now on my third attempt trying to get a repair shipping label from LG since they said they cannot send them immediately, it should be sent by the end of the day. Worst experience with both Amazon and LG ever. Would not recommend either since neither are willing to replace the monitor.Update: Was able to send the unit for repair through the LG website. This has been the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. First it took 5 attempts to get their support staff to send an email with the shipping label which took over a week of back and forth them telling me to wait and then me complaining that it shouldnt be this difficult to send me a shipping label. Though the repair took about 1 week after the allotted shipping time which was quick. The downside was the unit was not fixed at all, it still had the same issue where it would get a line glitching across the screen and then goes blank for up to 30 seconds. So now the day I got it back I am now being asked to wait for another shipping label for them to repair my unit again, this time I asked for a new unit as replacement but they refused since they demand I have to send it in at least 3 times for repair before that can be an option. LG make terrible products and I will actively tell others to avoid their garbage products and support.Update 2: Just received the monitor from repairs from LG, they sent it without the power cable and am now waiting to hear back about what they can do for me. Cant even test the monitor if it has been properly fixed until I get a new power cable. Very disappointing and extremely frustrating experience dealing with their support services for repairs."
