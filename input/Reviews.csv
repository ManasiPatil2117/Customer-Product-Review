Good quality very good whenever u traveling to other countries where you can't use you normal charges.but charging is slow.
The product is in very good condition and working well .There is heating effect in the product.
Works good
Very compact. Most interestingly the Australian and US type plugs are available within the same slot  thereby making the product less bulky. The main plug in the UK type can be a little more stable though. Overall value for money.

"This adapter is rugged, and is compatible with all the different kinds of wall sockets. It helped charge my phone and my laptop quickly and easily while travelling abroad. One nice feature is that a red lamp glows when the current is flowing through the adapter, so you are sure that there is a proper connection to the socket, even before you connect your device to the adapter. A good buy, and value for money. The colours available are good as well."
Everything is great!! Fully satisfied
