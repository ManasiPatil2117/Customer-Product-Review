Great",N/A,"It's very cool! I get a lot of people asking me about it. It feels weighted/sturdy without being heavy so it's not as easy to drop, has impressive camera quality and of course the flip function. It is a soft close so you can't snap it shut with the flick of your wrist, so I'm not worried about hinge damage. The screen is comfortable to hold despite its 6.8"" size. The cover screen is  easy to navigate (short tutorial provided) and gives you plenty of space to see your notifications. I've noticed bugs like with YouTube Music once I got this phone, it started skipping forward in the song, which my S20 did not do however this is probably fixable? The phone is super new so updates may take care of this hopefully.Also note the lavender option is pink with maybe purple undertones so you will be disappointed if you expect purple. I like pink so I'm fine with it.if you want the same specs as their Ultra versions, you may be disappointed. I personally love the camera (and have gotten compliments on it) and I can wait until the end of the day before I charge this, but I've heard people point out that Samsung's other phones are more advanced like with a bigger battery, higher camera MP, etc but I don't think the average consumer needs super high numbers in those areas. I don't regret my choice at all and I actually think this phone is still a better investment than other models. It's hard to beat a touch-screen flip phone and everything looks great to the eye. I am overall pleased and I recommend. Will update if anything changes."

Amazing, So Happy I Got It",N/A,"I have been wanting the flip for so long and I finally took the leap. I'm so glad I did. Right off the bat, the only con is the slight crease. It doesn't bother me at all, but I can definitely feel it, and can definitely see it in some angles. Also the screen protector can be somewhat difficult to install.Pros: Battery life is great, camera is amazing, the screen is super responsive/smooth, and the front screen is such a cool feature, and so useful.I find myself flipping the phone shut as soon as I'm done using it and that's really helped me with my screen time. Sort of out of sight, out of mind. And because I can flip it shut, I can tuck it into smaller spaces. It even fits in my front pocket! This is unheard of for me.And the phone cases?? So cute. I love this phone."

Hermoso, sensación premium y revolucionario",N/A,"El Samsung Z flip 5 es una opción para alguien que se arriesga a tener algo diferente. La sensación es muy premium buenos acabados se ve robusto a pesar de ser un teléfono plegable, tiene muy buenas cámaras, las opciones de personalización son infinitas y One UI te ofrece miles de posibilidades además de características exclusivas al ser plegable.Ponerlo en diferentes ángulos como cuando vas a ver un video en YouTube es genial para la salud de las manos y la muñeca creo que en el futuro muchas más personas verán las bondades de tener un plegable.La pantalla es increíble y la pantalla flex es muy practica aunque con todo y good lock sigue siendo algo limitada son puntos a mejorar.Único punto en contra veo que la batería no es su fuertePunto a destacar funciona perfectamente en Panamá"

HUGE jump in camera and battery quality!",N/A,"I traded in my Z Flip3 (which I LOVED despite the pretty good cameras and bad battery life) for the Z Flip5, and I am SO glad I did.The cameras on the Z Flip5 are MUCH better, rivaling some of the pictures I took even on my S23 Ultra (hard to believe, I know). They're super rich in color, detailed, beautiful blurring for closer shots... Overall really incredible cameras.The battery life has to be the biggest upgrade, especially coming from the Z Flip3. The Z Flip5's battery easily lasts me twice as long as the Z Flip3's, and I'm a pretty heavy user.Not to mention, the massive cover screen is beautiful and is able to run almost any app with Good Lock (even games like Genshin Impact run relatively smoothly, though I'm not sure why anyone would want to play Genshin on the cover screen). This phone is really a game changer for me, and I can't see myself leaving the Z Flip family any time soon."

V good h/w, lacking S/w",N/A,We've had this since release date. Love the form factor. It lacks the telephoto lens which is a real drag.  The cover screen hardly supports anything at all! It doesn't even support the native Samsung apps such as Samsung wallet which would make it so useful!  Until they fix the software I do not recommend buying this hardware.

40 days and the screen broke",N/A,"I did not buy from this seller, and I mean no harm to them. Just a heads up! I had this phone for 40 days and the screen snapped. I am not a teenager, nor do I abuse my phones. In the 25 years I had cell phone this is the first one that has ever broken. Absolutely pristine condition. truly ""like new"". Just opened it to answer a call, and snap! screen broke under the outer layer. Again....no harm meant to this seller."

HUGE jump in camera and battery quality!",N/A,"I traded in my Z Flip3 (which I LOVED despite the pretty good cameras and bad battery life) for the Z Flip5, and I am SO glad I did.The cameras on the Z Flip5 are MUCH better, rivaling some of the pictures I took even on my S23 Ultra (hard to believe, I know). They're super rich in color, detailed, beautiful blurring for closer shots... Overall really incredible cameras.The battery life has to be the biggest upgrade, especially coming from the Z Flip3. The Z Flip5's battery easily lasts me twice as long as the Z Flip3's, and I'm a pretty heavy user.Not to mention, the massive cover screen is beautiful and is able to run almost any app with Good Lock (even games like Genshin Impact run relatively smoothly, though I'm not sure why anyone would want to play Genshin on the cover screen). This phone is really a game changer for me, and I can't see myself leaving the Z Flip family any time soon."

V good h/w, lacking S/w",N/A,We've had this since release date. Love the form factor. It lacks the telephoto lens which is a real drag.  The cover screen hardly supports anything at all! It doesn't even support the native Samsung apps such as Samsung wallet which would make it so useful!  Until they fix the software I do not recommend buying this hardware.

40 days and the screen broke",N/A,"I did not buy from this seller, and I mean no harm to them. Just a heads up! I had this phone for 40 days and the screen snapped. I am not a teenager, nor do I abuse my phones. In the 25 years I had cell phone this is the first one that has ever broken. Absolutely pristine condition. truly ""like new"". Just opened it to answer a call, and snap! screen broke under the outer layer. Again....no harm meant to this seller."

Great",N/A,"It's very cool! I get a lot of people asking me about it. It feels weighted/sturdy without being heavy so it's not as easy to drop, has impressive camera quality and of course the flip function. It is a soft close so you can't snap it shut with the flick of your wrist, so I'm not worried about hinge damage. The screen is comfortable to hold despite its 6.8"" size. The cover screen is  easy to navigate (short tutorial provided) and gives you plenty of space to see your notifications. I've noticed bugs like with YouTube Music once I got this phone, it started skipping forward in the song, which my S20 did not do however this is probably fixable? The phone is super new so updates may take care of this hopefully.Also note the lavender option is pink with maybe purple undertones so you will be disappointed if you expect purple. I like pink so I'm fine with it.if you want the same specs as their Ultra versions, you may be disappointed. I personally love the camera (and have gotten compliments on it) and I can wait until the end of the day before I charge this, but I've heard people point out that Samsung's other phones are more advanced like with a bigger battery, higher camera MP, etc but I don't think the average consumer needs super high numbers in those areas. I don't regret my choice at all and I actually think this phone is still a better investment than other models. It's hard to beat a touch-screen flip phone and everything looks great to the eye. I am overall pleased and I recommend. Will update if anything changes."

Amazing, So Happy I Got It",N/A,"I have been wanting the flip for so long and I finally took the leap. I'm so glad I did. Right off the bat, the only con is the slight crease. It doesn't bother me at all, but I can definitely feel it, and can definitely see it in some angles. Also the screen protector can be somewhat difficult to install.Pros: Battery life is great, camera is amazing, the screen is super responsive/smooth, and the front screen is such a cool feature, and so useful.I find myself flipping the phone shut as soon as I'm done using it and that's really helped me with my screen time. Sort of out of sight, out of mind. And because I can flip it shut, I can tuck it into smaller spaces. It even fits in my front pocket! This is unheard of for me.And the phone cases?? So cute. I love this phone."

Hermoso, sensación premium y revolucionario",N/A,"El Samsung Z flip 5 es una opción para alguien que se arriesga a tener algo diferente. La sensación es muy premium buenos acabados se ve robusto a pesar de ser un teléfono plegable, tiene muy buenas cámaras, las opciones de personalización son infinitas y One UI te ofrece miles de posibilidades además de características exclusivas al ser plegable.Ponerlo en diferentes ángulos como cuando vas a ver un video en YouTube es genial para la salud de las manos y la muñeca creo que en el futuro muchas más personas verán las bondades de tener un plegable.La pantalla es increíble y la pantalla flex es muy practica aunque con todo y good lock sigue siendo algo limitada son puntos a mejorar.Único punto en contra veo que la batería no es su fuertePunto a destacar funciona perfectamente en Panamá"
