Missing Pieces",N/A,"We were going on a trip and I was really excited about bringing this specific game for a few reasons. 1. STEM games keep the kids entertained. 2. It’s lightweight. 3 it came with a little bag making it travel friendly. 4. The upgraded version seemed to be durable and child proof. Well… as we opened up the box and tried following the patterns included in the book, we noticed that we didn’t have enough pieces. I counted and we received 25 (instead of the 30 advertised) pieces. Unfortunately we weren’t able to build anything significant and the kids were more frustrated than excited. It’s a fun toy but I won’t buy again. If I had to buy again, I’d rather invest in Picasso tiles."

It’s lightweight. 3 it came with a little bag making it travel friendly. 4. The upgraded version seemed to be durable and child proof. Well… as we opened up the box and tried following the patterns included in the book, we noticed that we didn’t have enough pieces. I counted and we received 25 (instead of the 30 advertised) pieces. Unfortunately we weren’t able to build anything significant and the kids were more frustrated than excited. It’s a fun toy but I won’t buy again. If I had to buy again, I’d rather invest in Picasso tiles."

weak magnets",N/A,"Ordered for my young grandchildren. The magnets used are very weak, so it is almost impossible to bild with them. My grandchildren became quickly frustrated with them. Ordered another brand and was very happy. I should have returned them."

There's a reason it's a good price...",N/A,Very small and not enough of them. One of the magnet have already broken and I haven't even had it for a week

Not strong enough",N/A,"My son collects Magformers so I thought these would be a cheaper option, but they aren't nearly the quality. The magnets don't hold at all, so any build is impossible. Just spend the extra money and get Magformers."

1p 2023-04-13 These are not the ""Upgraded"" blocks.",N/A,"These blocks have exposed magnets that easily fall out and create a choking hazard.The upgraded blocks the magnets are built into each piece and there is no danger of the magnets falling out.This product is NOT the upgraded version and Amazon should not be selling them.Update: The company said they would refund my money AND send send me a new set of the ^Other"" upgraded blocks.They did neither. I gave the blocks to a friend who works for customs to use as an example of items that should not pass through Customs."

No es lo que ofrecen .",N/A,"Son muy pequeños y poca cantidad, en la descripción ofrecen algo más que por alguna razón no cumplen, no creo que valga la pena no los recomiendo ."

Not as pictured",N/A,This is a really tiny set.  The box is 6 inches by 6 inches.  There aren’t enough blocks to build the examples pictured in the product description.  Very small cheaply made set of blocks

Misleading Pictures",N/A,They don’t tell you there are only 30 pieces in the very small box. They mislead you to think there are way more pieces than there are. I could find something similar at the dollar store. Oh and they just changed the age from 8 to 3.
