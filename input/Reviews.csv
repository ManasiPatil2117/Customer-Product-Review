Value for money performance super no heating issue no hanging nice mobile
"Cons :NONEPros :Everything is great about this phone1. Camera is no match2. Battery is superb3. OS is so smooth4. No lagThis is my first iphone and I am loving it. I have used samsung, motorola and oneplus, really they are nowhere near iphone in quality.It doesn't matter how much costlier android phone you buy it will not match the features of iphone."
Initially I was really skeptical about buying it from Amazon . But I am really satisfied and and happy with the phone. The delivery was done before the actual delivery date.
I have been using iPhone from last 8 year so I am aware of the quality and the features so nothing much to share since its elite in this segment.Just one thing the that iPhone I received was not sealed pack so Amazon team requested to check on the secure packaging like Flipkart
"Best to buy on big billion days to get it for best price we bought 3 colour was good and iphone is all about brand (Apple) and it's camera (cinematic mode) now with improved battery, there is no point for hang in. IOS as they built with bionic chipset smooth and fast performance, go for it if your budget price is within 45-50K"
The phone looks very sharp and Fantastic...The In hand feel is very premium üëå

"No suprises here, iPhone is known for its uber quality. Camera is great but the real deal winner is the IOS experience. For someone who usee android for the last 10 years, the change was gleefuly accepted due to immaculate rendering of UI experience & performance of IOS."
CHARGER CABLE IS DUPLICATE
Heating issue!
Its an amazing product but battery drains too fast
"Nice product very good camera,I purchased only 42k good deal üî•"

Good phone. But camera quality is average. But i got in Great indian sale at 43749 so in this price it's good.
"I recently purchased the iPhone 13 from Amazon and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. Given the skepticism around online purchases, especially for high-end electronics, I was initially apprehensive. People warned me about the possibility of receiving a fake or subpar product, which left me a bit worried.However, I'm thrilled to report that my concerns were completely unfounded. The iPhone 13 I received was genuine and in impeccable condition. Its performance and features are top-notch, showcasing Apple's commitment to quality and innovation.This experience has reaffirmed my trust in online shopping, and I can confidently say that my purchase was a resounding success. If you're considering buying the iPhone 13, rest assured that Amazon delivered a product that lives up to Apple's high standards. I'm thoroughly satisfied with my new phone and highly recommend it to others."

Great Product but battery get low early
Compact screen size with best display and battery is average not as expected but good for medium user and heating sometimes while turn on wifi and watching videos for long time and excellent cameras and without case it attracts fingerprints and network issues while turn on mobile data and playing youtube videos some lag and sound is good from speaker .
Got same as ordered
Good product by
"I upgrade from 12 mini to 13 and i can feel the difference between them.  The bigger display, the optimisation, smoothness and also in camera. Playing BGMI is like cutting the butter. No frame drop no lagüî•. In case of gaming experience, it can beat any android flagship phone anytime. And the battery backup is also amazing. I played almost 2.5h and the battery drop is 44%. Optimisations in ios17 is very good. I brought this from amazon great india sale in 44k. I think its value for mone rather than purchasing any flagship android having 120hz display. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
I love itüíô

"When I ordered it in amazon I was skeptical, but I got the original piece. And the phone is simply awesome in terms of camera, display(even though 60 hz), performance, IOS everything is great. Even battery longs 7 to 8 hours at 80‚Ä¢/‚Ä¢ charge and phone doesn‚Äôt get hot at high throtteling. If anyone buying their 1st iPhone I recommend uu to buy this phone. You will have a great experience. THANK YOU üôèüèº"
"It was my transition from android to IOS and to be honest, I have loved this iPhone. The UI is smooth, the transitions are nice and the battery also lasts for a day almost. I recommend everyone to go for it. The only thing which bothers me is that it doesn't have 120 Hz display BUT you will not feel it frequently, it is really smooth."
"Image quality is awesome. All the camera lovers are gonna love it. Dynamic range is super awesome. No colour shift frim main and ultrawide camera. For me switching from android to iOS‚Ä¶ it takes some time to adapt. But believe me, its a great experience.As i was having an iPad , so iphone combined gives me a great experience.The only con I found is the battery experience. Compared to the android phones at this price range‚Ä¶ the battery is good‚Ä¶ will last u for a day, but should be better ."
"First thing first, checked if the product was original or not. For that, check the following1. If the screen has ‚ÄúTrue Tone‚Äù option.2. Check the Serial Number for ‚ÄúM‚Äù letter, indicates its new unit.3. Check if IMEI number of the product is same as mentioned on the box.4. Battery Health should be 100%.Pros:1. Camera is one of the best I have used so far.2. Haptic feedback is very great. I noticed it instantly.3. Battery optimisation is very good. It‚Äôs been more than a month and I have never charged it more than 85%. Still I get a days battery easily.4. OS. I have used Android before this. And change in OS was good change as well.Cons:Charge speed is slow. I only charge it when the battery % is around 20%. And it takes 1 to 1.5 hr to charge.Comments:I don‚Äôt play any games or do any heavy usage tasks on phone. It‚Äôs just daily tasks like social media, YouTube, etc."

"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customization is really good and you can customize a lot of things."
"I have seen that many Amazon users have been skeptical about purchasing iPhone from Darshita ezone or Darshita electronics. After I ordered the product red iPhone 13 from Darshita ezone, because of these negative reviews, even I got scared. However, I didn't cancel my order and decided to wait. Though Amazon delivered the order little late than I expected, I have received a genuine iPhone 13 product red. I checked the model number and IMEI number. All are perfect. Have been using the phone for almost 3 weeks now. Even updated to iOS 17. It's a gem. No issues. No problem. Heating is understandable during charging. But that's already expected. Thumbs up to both Amazon and Darshita ezone. And do I need to write about iPhone 13? It's awesome already."
"This is my first iPhone shifted from an android and gosh this is such an awesome phone, very well managed battery usage awesome camera video camera quality top of the lineüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è and plus it‚Äôs so smooth and no ads or bloatware apps like in android just superb only two issue slow battery charging and 60hz refresh rate feels lil bit slow my last device was of 120 hz"
"I was using old gen iphone previously, this is pretty good upgrade. The black color is really good first of all and the Performance is obviously more than enough for my usage, Camera quality and everything else is pretty good except the battery life because that‚Äôs alright and not the best as i have experienced better to be honest but it does provide battery life for a whole day till now and from what i‚Äôve heard it will maintain to do so till it reaches approximately 95% battery health."
"I am writing this review after 10 days of using this phone. Now i can relate why no one wants to leave iPhone after using it once. Similarly i never want to switch back to any android phone ever. Thank you amazon for a one day delivery. Reflexive touch, vivid display, amazing camera quality and much more."
I am moving from Android to ios for the first time. It is been a marvelous experience to use iPhone. I regret now for being an android user. First of all the speed what they have mentioned as lightening speed yes i have experienced the lightening speed. Anything u share in whatsapp or any app u open it opens up in a flash. When I put the phone on charging it sometimes over heat the phone but now i have identified the reason for it too. Do not use the phone When on charging leave it untouched so that it won't over heat. No sort of pauses aur hanging issues at all.

"Decent battery backup. Good pics. Battery comparison can be done with 4000 mah android. In android you can access everything seamlessly but not in case of IOS.Anyways, I made a decision to go for iPhone 13 instead of 14 coz it‚Äôs 10k grands lesser can easily compromise and adjust on 2gb extra Ram in 14. Apple devices doesn‚Äôt hang, unless you utilise entire ROM. Love iPhone 13"

"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone."
"I recently bought my first ever Apple iPhone 13 Midnight from the Great Indian Sale at 45k and I'm thrilled. It's slim, elegant, and the Midnight color is striking. After using for more than 7days it‚Äôs Performance with the A15 Bionic chip is outstanding, the camera captures amazing photos, and the Super Retina XDR display is a visual treat. It's 5G-ready, secure with Face ID, and arrives promptly from Aappario. If you want a top-tier smartphone that's stylish, this is it. If you want to buy an iPhone and for first time, then I prefer this for u!! ü•∞ü§©"

"Many people says ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt like iPhones, android is better than iOS etc etc‚ÄùThe reason can be anything but mainly that is affordability.However, after shifting to iOS from Android. My honest opinion is there‚Äôs simply shouldn‚Äôt be any argument over this topic as iPhones stand way ahead of any literally any Android device in every single way.There‚Äôs a saying that ‚Äúif apple doesn‚Äôt want do it, you can‚Äôt make them do it but once they do it, you can‚Äôt complain about it‚ÄùNext level optimisation on everything. Perfect device for minimal and easy going people like me."
"I've been using the iPhone 13 for a month now, and I'm extremely satisfied with its performance. The A15 Bionic chip delivers lightning-fast speed, and the battery life is impressive, easily lasting me a full day. The camera system produces stunning photos and videos in various lighting conditions. The Super Retina XDR display is vibrant, and the 120Hz ProMotion makes scrolling and animations buttery smooth. Overall, it's a fantastic device with only a few minor drawbacks like the lack of a charger and a heating issue."
"It has been about a month since received the phone. My over all experience of using it has been excellent as of now. But the only thing which I felt compromised is the battery life. When using often, I am seeing the battery getting drained fast.Except that, everything has been in line with my expectations from an Iphone."
"It is amazing me everyday , so many practical and professional features are there ,Awsome display , 20% brightness is enough for indoor activities,The smoothness of the UI is next level experience, the fluid like experience will make you praise it every now and then ,The feel in hand is very premium, feels true to its valueThe battery backup is phenomenal, for normal usage , it can cover upto 1-1.5 day easily on 100% charge , more than that maybe , depends on the casual usageThe camera is out of the world , the colour accuracy is on point, it completely true to natural, you will totally get the colour as I saw when I was taking it ,The skin tone is very accurate for selfies ,Compact size makes it slide into the palm of your hand.Sound quality is very natural, very loud , vocals are clear , very pleasing to earsOne word its awsome, I have bought it for 46000 during sale , every penny of it is truly valued"
"I recently purchased the iPhone 13 from Amazon, and my overall experience has been quite positive. The battery life is impressive, easily lasting a full day of use. However, I did find that Apple has made some settings more complex than necessary, which can be a bit frustrating. On the bright side, the camera quality is exceptional, earning a solid 5/5 rating. The A15 chip's performance is also commendable, ensuring smooth and efficient operation. All in all, despite a few intricate settings, the iPhone 13 delivers outstanding camera capabilities and robust performance, making it a great choice for those seeking a top-notch smartphone."
"I was a Android user after several years I'm buying iphone , Was very sceptical of online ordering I mean the costly items but to my surprise everything went so smooth and very happy with the order. I got best offer and very cheap also got my fav colour red. all I want to say is if you want to get it this is the best time iphone 14 not worth the price if u have older phone jst go to iphone 13 or 15 next year.
