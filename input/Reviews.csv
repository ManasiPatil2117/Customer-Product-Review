Mic issues right out of the box.  Right earphone stopped working after 3 months.",N/A,"This was my main headset that I purchased in the middle of December.  Right out of the box I plugged everything in and had an annoying echo in Discord.  Whenever anything would come through my headset it would be played back to my friends in Discord.  After troubleshooting for about an hour it just stopped on it's own.  Chalked it up to a mild annoyance and carried on.Only two months into owning this product the right headphone is almost non existent as far as producing sound.  I untangled the chord and was able to have normal sound for only a couple of more weeks until it stopped working all together.  I am going to spend a little more and buy a wireless headset.  If you're looking for something that will only last you for a couple of months then this is fine but I had two major issues with this product in only three months time.Update 3/27 - Found out my issue is with the volume adjuster and mic mute module that basically splits the headphone from the top to the bottom of the chord.  If I physically push the volume wheel into the module the connection briefly comes back in my right earphone.  Unacceptable for the wiring and device to physically break like this without any physical damage or dropping of the product.  Even for a cheaper alternative like this product it should not just wear down, tangle, and break as easily as this does.  Spend a little extra money and get something that won't fall apart after only 2-3 months of use."

Oddly placed volume adjustment causes the cable to swing wildly with every head movement.",N/A,"Bulky, cable is one of those that gets twists in it easily. I despise the connection. It's split into a Y with about 5 inches for each of the two, a USB and a male adapter for sound. The USB is purely for the lights on the side, which I don't need or want. The volume control is about ten inches down from the connection to the headset itself, so it's swinging weight is distracting. It'd be better to either have volume adjustment on the earpiece or lower on the cable so it can be rested on something and not swinging with every head turn. The over the ear cups are great, and are comfortable to wear. The mic boom is not flexible to adjust closer to your mouth, so you still have to speak louder than I'd like to while wearing a headphone. Looks dumb when lit up. I don't use the power for that while wearing them.**EDIT**Bengoo contacted me and attempted to give me a free headset after my initial 3 star review. I told them that if there were no changes in the design then it would be pointless, as I'm not looking for another exact item, only free. They then asked me to change or hide my review. Be wary.**SECOND EDIT**Received this email Christmas Eve in my spam folder from ""Beth Marshall"". These Chinese sellers are trying way too hard:Dear J.This is Chris, apologizing for the uncomfortable experience that our BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 bring to you.I am a small seller of Amazon. My bankruptcy when I was young led my wife to stay away from me. I take care of three children myself. Parents are seriously ill and their age is already very large. So the whole family’s hope lies in this product.Due to my long lack of sleep, there is a problem with the manufacturer and my communication, and it appears on some products. The bad experience of the product is directly related to this.I apologize to you again. These bad reviews bother me because my mistakes give you a bad shopping experience and I can't sleep.I will pay you $ 48 for your unsatisfactory shopping experience. At the same time, I will try my best to do it. I hope you can forgive my fault.Could you help me to remove?  here is link for review:I deeply beg you to update your comment.

SHOULD SAY FOR COMPUTER PLAY HEADSET NOT CONSOLE.",N/A,Sound is good but the length of wire for remote play is beyond short this product should note that this is a headset for computer play rather then actual ps4 play with a remote my son has to sit right in front of TV in order to play damaging his eye sight I will be returning than tonight for a refund.

The price is low for a reason",N/A,"TLDR: Not worth your money, keep looking for a better headset.My old headset died after a little more than a year of daily use, so I did what most of us do and jumped on Amazon to grab a replacement. Found this model for $26 and next day shipping so I figured ""How bad could it be?"". Pulling it out of the box it felt cheaply made, but for the price that didn't bother me. I plugged the headset in and immediately noticed the low sound quality. Everything sounds muffled and quieter than I'd like with the volume maxed out. I turned my applications up to make up the difference before finding out that the mic wasn't working at all. I troubleshooted from my end thinking it was a driver issue, but eventually had to concede that the headset simply doesn't work...I tried getting product support only to find that there is no product support. The support website link took me to a digital pdf of the same instruction manual the headset came with in the box. I didn't think you could get scammed through Amazon, but I'm pretty sure that's what happened. I might have just gotten a defective product, that can happen to anyone from time to time, but seeing what came to my house I wish I had just spent a bit more on a decent headset."

Stupid design, too big, uncomfortable on head",N/A,"Stupid design: you have to plug it in with a USB and an Aux cable- the end is split into these 2 ends. However, that just makes the headset's headphones work. In order for the mic to work you have to plug the Aux cable into a splitter (provided) that goes into a headphone jack and a mic jack. So you have to plug this thing in at THREE SEPERATE POINTS... why? Why would it not just work with the USB cable? and what is the USB cable even doing, you might ask? The lights.. the dumb lights on the headset are being powered by the USB connection, that's the USB connection's only function.Too big: the thing is monstrous, there's a lot of extra material here.Uncomfortable on head: Despite the extra material in the headset it is lacking in padding material- the headphone cups are uncomfortable and the curve of the bulky headset is too strong- it pushes around the ear too hard, right on nausea-inducing pressure points.The audio quality is good, and maybe you have a smaller head than mine? it might not be uncomfortable on your head, but I didn't even get to test the outgoing quality on the mic because I'm not plugging a headset into 3 different jacks- my laptop doesn't have that many and I'm not going to bring this upstairs to my desktop, I already know I'm returning it... don't buy this thing."

Does not give refunds",N/A,"July 2023 we purchased the headset as a gift for our son. When he opened it a week later, there was a piece of plastic shaking around inside the unit. We plugged it in and the microphone didn't work so I returned it ( within a week of receiving it. Three months later, the return has yet to be refunded to me. The product quality is not great. I'd stay away and purchase elsewhere."

Stopped working after just four months",N/A,My son bought this headset June 7th. Yesterday Oct 5th one side stopped working. Today it's completely broken... nothing works on it anymore. I've got 4 kids and we have used all different kinds of headsets over the years... these lasted the shortest amount of time so far. Tried to contact the company thru Amazon and it just brings me to a link to download the user's manual.

The cords keep breaking",N/A,"Here’s the deal. I’ve bought and used several of these headphones. And it’s always the same problem: the damn cord breaks. I use on my xbox pro controller. I don’t mistreat my gear, it just happens over time. And I’m sick of it. I’m sick of wasting money having to buy new headphones every few months. I’m done. Don’t waste your money on this crap."

Never trust the Bengoos",N/A,"One night your headphones break…. And you check Amazon for a new pair of cheap headphones. You may stumble across a pair of nice looking headphones, which are only $19.99 and a whopping 60% discount. Trust me, there is a reason these nightmare bengoo’s are more than half off. You may think these headphones look legit, but once you plug them into your controller, all hell breaks loose. Not only will the legendary bengoos lodge out of your controller about 6 times per minute… if you are ever in a gaming party, I want to say good luck to the other soldiers in that chat. They may think you just bought a new pair of nice headphones, but little do they know they are about to enter the midst of a modern war fare multiplayer lobby. The sound everyone hears when you pop on the bengoos, mirror the sound of a precision air strike happening 24/7 in the mic… one would assume you are in the middle of a war. If you are ever thinking of acquiring a pair of bengoo headphones… make sure you don’t have any friends, because you will lose them very quickly when you destroy their ears in a game chat.I am warning you now. Once you acquire a bengoo… the rest is on you good sir."

Audio is Good, everything else was trouble",N/A,"I play on a Nintendo Switch, so this review is for Nintendo Switch Players:The Audio was very good on this headset, but everything else was bothersome. I had ordered these multiple time and all times they stopped working or had another issue within a couple months of daily usage.The Mic is horrible in sense of echo, literally have to turn down Voice Chat Volume to 30% in Overwatch 2 to stop echo. On Apex Legends I have to turn my Mic near mute to stop Echo.The Wires are troublesome as hell as they get easily tangled and got to a point where I couldn’t get them to un-wrangle. Especially since I play docked to a TV and need to sit closer than usual due to me being near-sighted in my left eye and not being able to see detail in my right eye due to Amblyopia.Final statement is don’t buy this if you hate echo and wire problems. Not good for sitting near the tv at all.Definitely won’t be buying this specific headset every agin.Sincerely,Victor Keeler"

On Apex Legends I have to turn my Mic near mute to stop Echo.The Wires are troublesome as hell as they get easily tangled and got to a point where I couldn’t get them to un-wrangle. Especially since I play docked to a TV and need to sit closer than usual due to me being near-sighted in my left eye and not being able to see detail in my right eye due to Amblyopia.Final statement is don’t buy this if you hate echo and wire problems. Not good for sitting near the tv at all.Definitely won’t be buying this specific headset every agin.Sincerely,Victor Keeler"

Mic issues right out of the box.  Right earphone stopped working after 3 months.",N/A,"This was my main headset that I purchased in the middle of December.  Right out of the box I plugged everything in and had an annoying echo in Discord.  Whenever anything would come through my headset it would be played back to my friends in Discord.  After troubleshooting for about an hour it just stopped on it's own.  Chalked it up to a mild annoyance and carried on.Only two months into owning this product the right headphone is almost non existent as far as producing sound.  I untangled the chord and was able to have normal sound for only a couple of more weeks until it stopped working all together.  I am going to spend a little more and buy a wireless headset.  If you're looking for something that will only last you for a couple of months then this is fine but I had two major issues with this product in only three months time.Update 3/27 - Found out my issue is with the volume adjuster and mic mute module that basically splits the headphone from the top to the bottom of the chord.  If I physically push the volume wheel into the module the connection briefly comes back in my right earphone.  Unacceptable for the wiring and device to physically break like this without any physical damage or dropping of the product.  Even for a cheaper alternative like this product it should not just wear down, tangle, and break as easily as this does.  Spend a little extra money and get something that won't fall apart after only 2-3 months of use."

Oddly placed volume adjustment causes the cable to swing wildly with every head movement.",N/A,"Bulky, cable is one of those that gets twists in it easily. I despise the connection. It's split into a Y with about 5 inches for each of the two, a USB and a male adapter for sound. The USB is purely for the lights on the side, which I don't need or want. The volume control is about ten inches down from the connection to the headset itself, so it's swinging weight is distracting. It'd be better to either have volume adjustment on the earpiece or lower on the cable so it can be rested on something and not swinging with every head turn. The over the ear cups are great, and are comfortable to wear. The mic boom is not flexible to adjust closer to your mouth, so you still have to speak louder than I'd like to while wearing a headphone. Looks dumb when lit up. I don't use the power for that while wearing them.**EDIT**Bengoo contacted me and attempted to give me a free headset after my initial 3 star review. I told them that if there were no changes in the design then it would be pointless, as I'm not looking for another exact item, only free. They then asked me to change or hide my review.

SHOULD SAY FOR COMPUTER PLAY HEADSET NOT CONSOLE.",N/A,Sound is good but the length of wire for remote play is beyond short this product should note that this is a headset for computer play rather then actual ps4 play with a remote my son has to sit right in front of TV in order to play damaging his eye sight I will be returning than tonight for a refund.

The price is low for a reason",N/A,"TLDR: Not worth your money, keep looking for a better headset.My old headset died after a little more than a year of daily use, so I did what most of us do and jumped on Amazon to grab a replacement. Found this model for $26 and next day shipping so I figured ""How bad could it be?"". Pulling it out of the box it felt cheaply made, but for the price that didn't bother me. I plugged the headset in and immediately noticed the low sound quality. Everything sounds muffled and quieter than I'd like with the volume maxed out. I turned my applications up to make up the difference before finding out that the mic wasn't working at all. I troubleshooted from my end thinking it was a driver issue, but eventually had to concede that the headset simply doesn't work...I tried getting product support only to find that there is no product support. The support website link took me to a digital pdf of the same instruction manual the headset came with in the box. I didn't think you could get scammed through Amazon, but I'm pretty sure that's what happened. I might have just gotten a defective product, that can happen to anyone from time to time, but seeing what came to my house I wish I had just spent a bit more on a decent headset."

Stupid design, too big, uncomfortable on head",N/A,"Stupid design: you have to plug it in with a USB and an Aux cable- the end is split into these 2 ends. However, that just makes the headset's headphones work. In order for the mic to work you have to plug the Aux cable into a splitter (provided) that goes into a headphone jack and a mic jack. So you have to plug this thing in at THREE SEPERATE POINTS... why? Why would it not just work with the USB cable? and what is the USB cable even doing, you might ask? The lights.. the dumb lights on the headset are being powered by the USB connection, that's the USB connection's only function.Too big: the thing is monstrous, there's a lot of extra material here.Uncomfortable on head: Despite the extra material in the headset it is lacking in padding material- the headphone cups are uncomfortable and the curve of the bulky headset is too strong- it pushes around the ear too hard, right on nausea-inducing pressure points.The audio quality is good, and maybe you have a smaller head than mine? it might not be uncomfortable on your head, but I didn't even get to test the outgoing quality on the mic because I'm not plugging a headset into 3 different jacks- my laptop doesn't have that many and I'm not going to bring this upstairs to my desktop, I already know I'm returning it... don't buy this thing."

We plugged it in and the microphone didn't work so I returned it ( within a week of receiving it. Three months later, the return has yet to be refunded to me. The product quality is not great. I'd stay away and purchase elsewhere."

Stopped working after just four months",N/A,My son bought this headset June 7th. Yesterday Oct 5th one side stopped working. Today it's completely broken... nothing works on it anymore. I've got 4 kids and we have used all different kinds of headsets over the years... these lasted the shortest amount of time so far. Tried to contact the company thru Amazon and it just brings me to a link to download the user's manual.

Never trust the Bengoos",N/A,"One night your headphones break…. And you check Amazon for a new pair of cheap headphones. You may stumble across a pair of nice looking headphones, which are only $19.99 and a whopping 60% discount. Trust me, there is a reason these nightmare bengoo’s are more than half off. You may think these headphones look legit, but once you plug them into your controller, all hell breaks loose. Not only will the legendary bengoos lodge out of your controller about 6 times per minute… if you are ever in a gaming party, I want to say good luck to the other soldiers in that chat. They may think you just bought a new pair of nice headphones, but little do they know they are about to enter the midst of a modern war fare multiplayer lobby. The sound everyone hears when you pop on the bengoos, mirror the sound of a precision air strike happening 24/7 in the mic… one would assume you are in the middle of a war. If you are ever thinking of acquiring a pair of bengoo headphones… make sure you don’t have any friends, because you will lose them very quickly when you destroy their ears in a game chat.I am warning you now. Once you acquire a bengoo… the rest is on you good sir."

The sound everyone hears when you pop on the bengoos, mirror the sound of a precision air strike happening 24/7 in the mic… one would assume you are in the middle of a war. If you are ever thinking of acquiring a pair of bengoo headphones… make sure you don’t have any friends, because you will lose them very quickly when you destroy their ears in a game chat.I am warning you now.

Audio is Good, everything else was trouble",N/A,"I play on a Nintendo Switch, so this review is for Nintendo Switch Players:The Audio was very good on this headset, but everything else was bothersome. I had ordered these multiple time and all times they stopped working or had another issue within a couple months of daily usage.The Mic is horrible in sense of echo, literally have to turn down Voice Chat Volume to 30% in Overwatch 2 to stop echo. On Apex Legends I have to turn my Mic near mute to stop Echo.The Wires are troublesome as hell as they get easily tangled and got to a point where I couldn’t get them to un-wrangle. Especially since I play docked to a TV and need to sit closer than usual due to me being near-sighted in my left eye and not being able to see detail in my right eye due to Amblyopia.Final statement is don’t buy this if you hate echo and wire problems. Not good for sitting near the tv at all.Definitely won’t be buying this specific headset every agin.Sincerely,Victor Keeler"

Mic issues right out of the box.  Right earphone stopped working after 3 months.",N/A,"This was my main headset that I purchased in the middle of December.  Right out of the box I plugged everything in and had an annoying echo in Discord.  Whenever anything would come through my headset it would be played back to my friends in Discord.  After troubleshooting for about an hour it just stopped on it's own.  Chalked it up to a mild annoyance and carried on.Only two months into owning this product the right headphone is almost non existent as far as producing sound.  I untangled the chord and was able to have normal sound for only a couple of more weeks until it stopped working all together.  I am going to spend a little more and buy a wireless headset.  If you're looking for something that will only last you for a couple of months then this is fine but I had two major issues with this product in only three months time.Update 3/27 - Found out my issue is with the volume adjuster and mic mute module that basically splits the headphone from the top to the bottom of the chord.  If I physically push the volume wheel into the module the connection briefly comes back in my right earphone.  Unacceptable for the wiring and device to physically break like this without any physical damage or dropping of the product.  Even for a cheaper alternative like this product it should not just wear down, tangle, and break as easily as this does.  Spend a little extra money and get something that won't fall apart after only 2-3 months of use."

Oddly placed volume adjustment causes the cable to swing wildly with every head movement.",N/A,"Bulky, cable is one of those that gets twists in it easily. I despise the connection. It's split into a Y with about 5 inches for each of the two, a USB and a male adapter for sound. The USB is purely for the lights on the side, which I don't need or want. The volume control is about ten inches down from the connection to the headset itself, so it's swinging weight is distracting. It'd be better to either have volume adjustment on the earpiece or lower on the cable so it can be rested on something and not swinging with every head turn. The over the ear cups are great, and are comfortable to wear. The mic boom is not flexible to adjust closer to your mouth, so you still have to speak louder than I'd like to while wearing a headphone. Looks dumb when lit up. I don't use the power for that while wearing them.**EDIT**Bengoo contacted me and attempted to give me a free headset after my initial 3 star review.

The price is low for a reason",N/A,"TLDR: Not worth your money, keep looking for a better headset.My old headset died after a little more than a year of daily use, so I did what most of us do and jumped on Amazon to grab a replacement. Found this model for $26 and next day shipping so I figured ""How bad could it be?"". Pulling it out of the box it felt cheaply made, but for the price that didn't bother me. I plugged the headset in and immediately noticed the low sound quality. Everything sounds muffled and quieter than I'd like with the volume maxed out. I turned my applications up to make up the difference before finding out that the mic wasn't working at all. I troubleshooted from my end thinking it was a driver issue, but eventually had to concede that the headset simply doesn't work...I tried getting product support only to find that there is no product support. The support website link took me to a digital pdf of the same instruction manual the headset came with in the box. I didn't think you could get scammed through Amazon, but I'm pretty sure that's what happened. I might have just gotten a defective product, that can happen to anyone from time to time, but seeing what came to my house I wish I had just spent a bit more on a decent headset."

Stupid design, too big, uncomfortable on head",N/A,"Stupid design: you have to plug it in with a USB and an Aux cable- the end is split into these 2 ends. However, that just makes the headset's headphones work. In order for the mic to work you have to plug the Aux cable into a splitter (provided) that goes into a headphone jack and a mic jack. So you have to plug this thing in at THREE SEPERATE POINTS... why? Why would it not just work with the USB cable? and what is the USB cable even doing, you might ask? The lights.. the dumb lights on the headset are being powered by the USB connection, that's the USB connection's only function.Too big: the thing is monstrous, there's a lot of extra material here.Uncomfortable on head: Despite the extra material in the headset it is lacking in padding material- the headphone cups are uncomfortable and the curve of the bulky headset is too strong- it pushes around the ear too hard, right on nausea-inducing pressure points.The audio quality is good, and maybe you have a smaller head than mine? it might not be uncomfortable on your head, but I didn't even get to test the outgoing quality on the mic because I'm not plugging a headset into 3 different jacks- my laptop doesn't have that many and I'm not going to bring this upstairs to my desktop, I already know I'm returning it... don't buy this thing."

Never trust the Bengoos",N/A,"One night your headphones break…. And you check Amazon for a new pair of cheap headphones. You may stumble across a pair of nice looking headphones, which are only $19.99 and a whopping 60% discount. Trust me, there is a reason these nightmare bengoo’s are more than half off. You may think these headphones look legit, but once you plug them into your controller, all hell breaks loose. Not only will the legendary bengoos lodge out of your controller about 6 times per minute… if you are ever in a gaming party, I want to say good luck to the other soldiers in that chat. They may think you just bought a new pair of nice headphones, but little do they know they are about to enter the midst of a modern war fare multiplayer lobby. The sound everyone hears when you pop on the bengoos, mirror the sound of a precision air strike happening 24/7 in the mic… one would assume you are in the middle of a war. If you are ever thinking of acquiring a pair of bengoo headphones… make sure you don’t have any friends, because you will lose them very quickly when you destroy their ears in a game chat.I am warning you now. Once you acquire a bengoo… the rest is on you good sir."

Audio is Good, everything else was trouble",N/A,"I play on a Nintendo Switch, so this review is for Nintendo Switch Players:The Audio was very good on this headset, but everything else was bothersome. I had ordered these multiple time and all times they stopped working or had another issue within a couple months of daily usage.The Mic is horrible in sense of echo, literally have to turn down Voice Chat Volume to 30% in Overwatch 2 to stop echo. On Apex Legends I have to turn my Mic near mute to stop Echo.The Wires are troublesome as hell as they get easily tangled and got to a point where I couldn’t get them to un-wrangle. Especially since I play docked to a TV and need to sit closer than usual due to me being near-sighted in my left eye and not being able to see detail in my right eye due to Amblyopia.Final statement is don’t buy this if you hate echo and wire problems. Not good for sitting near the tv at all.Definitely won’t be buying this specific headset every agin.Sincerely,Victor Keeler"

Mic issues right out of the box.  Right earphone stopped working after 3 months.",N/A,"This was my main headset that I purchased in the middle of December.  Right out of the box I plugged everything in and had an annoying echo in Discord.  Whenever anything would come through my headset it would be played back to my friends in Discord.  After troubleshooting for about an hour it just stopped on it's own.  Chalked it up to a mild annoyance and carried on.Only two months into owning this product the right headphone is almost non existent as far as producing sound.  I untangled the chord and was able to have normal sound for only a couple of more weeks until it stopped working all together.  I am going to spend a little more and buy a wireless headset.  If you're looking for something that will only last you for a couple of months then this is fine but I had two major issues with this product in only three months time.Update 3/27 - Found out my issue is with the volume adjuster and mic mute module that basically splits the headphone from the top to the bottom of the chord.  If I physically push the volume wheel into the module the connection briefly comes back in my right earphone.  Unacceptable for the wiring and device to physically break like this without any physical damage or dropping of the product.  Even for a cheaper alternative like this product it should not just wear down, tangle, and break as easily as this does.  Spend a little extra money and get something that won't fall apart after only 2-3 months of use."

Oddly placed volume adjustment causes the cable to swing wildly with every head movement.",N/A,"Bulky, cable is one of those that gets twists in it easily. I despise the connection. It's split into a Y with about 5 inches for each of the two, a USB and a male adapter for sound. The USB is purely for the lights on the side, which I don't need or want. The volume control is about ten inches down from the connection to the headset itself, so it's swinging weight is distracting. It'd be better to either have volume adjustment on the earpiece or lower on the cable so it can be rested on something and not swinging with every head turn. The over the ear cups are great, and are comfortable to wear. The mic boom is not flexible to adjust closer to your mouth, so you still have to speak louder than I'd like to while wearing a headphone. Looks dumb when lit up. I don't use the power for that while wearing them.**EDIT**Bengoo contacted me and attempted to give me a free headset after my initial 3 star review. I told them that if there were no changes in the design then it would be pointless, as I'm not looking for another exact item, only free. They then asked me to change or hide my review. Be wary.**SECOND EDIT**Received this email Christmas Eve in my spam folder from ""Beth Marshall"". These Chinese sellers are trying way too hard:Dear J.This is Chris, apologizing for the uncomfortable experience that our BENGOO G9000 Stereo Gaming Headset for PS4 bring to you.I am a small seller of Amazon. My bankruptcy when I was young led my wife to stay away from me. I take care of three children myself. Parents are seriously ill and their age is already very large. So the whole family’s hope lies in this product.Due to my long lack of sleep, there is a problem with the manufacturer and my communication, and it appears on some products. The bad experience of the product is directly related to this.I apologize to you again. These bad reviews bother me because my mistakes give you a bad shopping experience and I can't sleep.I will pay you $ 48 for your unsatisfactory shopping experience. At the same time, I will try my best to do it. I hope you can forgive my fault.Could you help me to remove?  here is link for review:I deeply beg you to update your comment. Can you give me a reply when you see this email? thanks again. I wish you happiness forever.SincerelyChrisComment updated, ""Chris"". Mission accomplished.**THIRD EDIT** 21MAY20These commies are still harassing me to change my review and offering me money to do so. They've been reported to Amazon several times to no avail."

SHOULD SAY FOR COMPUTER PLAY HEADSET NOT CONSOLE.",N/A,Sound is good but the length of wire for remote play is beyond short this product should note that this is a headset for computer play rather then actual ps4 play with a remote my son has to sit right in front of TV in order to play damaging his eye sight I will be returning than tonight for a refund. Son very disappointed.  I can't afford 70 headset . Son is autistic and now I have to deal with the out bursts of him I could barely afford these . But I guess you get what u paid for.....

The price is low for a reason",N/A,"TLDR: Not worth your money, keep looking for a better headset.My old headset died after a little more than a year of daily use, so I did what most of us do and jumped on Amazon to grab a replacement. Found this model for $26 and next day shipping so I figured ""How bad could it be?"". Pulling it out of the box it felt cheaply made, but for the price that didn't bother me. I plugged the headset in and immediately noticed the low sound quality. Everything sounds muffled and quieter than I'd like with the volume maxed out. I turned my applications up to make up the difference before finding out that the mic wasn't working at all. I troubleshooted from my end thinking it was a driver issue, but eventually had to concede that the headset simply doesn't work...I tried getting product support only to find that there is no product support. The support website link took me to a digital pdf of the same instruction manual the headset came with in the box. I didn't think you could get scammed through Amazon, but I'm pretty sure that's what happened. I might have just gotten a defective product, that can happen to anyone from time to time, but seeing what came to my house I wish I had just spent a bit more on a decent headset."

Stupid design, too big, uncomfortable on head",N/A,"Stupid design: you have to plug it in with a USB and an Aux cable- the end is split into these 2 ends. However, that just makes the headset's headphones work. In order for the mic to work you have to plug the Aux cable into a splitter (provided) that goes into a headphone jack and a mic jack. So you have to plug this thing in at THREE SEPERATE POINTS... why? Why would it not just work with the USB cable? and what is the USB cable even doing, you might ask? The lights.. the dumb lights on the headset are being powered by the USB connection, that's the USB connection's only function.Too big: the thing is monstrous, there's a lot of extra material here.Uncomfortable on head: Despite the extra material in the headset it is lacking in padding material- the headphone cups are uncomfortable and the curve of the bulky headset is too strong- it pushes around the ear too hard, right on nausea-inducing pressure points.The audio quality is good, and maybe you have a smaller head than mine? it might not be uncomfortable on your head, but I didn't even get to test the outgoing quality on the mic because I'm not plugging a headset into 3 different jacks- my laptop doesn't have that many and I'm not going to bring this upstairs to my desktop, I already know I'm returning it... don't buy this thing."

Does not give refunds",N/A,"July 2023 we purchased the headset as a gift for our son. When he opened it a week later, there was a piece of plastic shaking around inside the unit. We plugged it in and the microphone didn't work so I returned it ( within a week of receiving it. Three months later, the return has yet to be refunded to me. The product quality is not great. I'd stay away and purchase elsewhere."

Stopped working after just four months",N/A,My son bought this headset June 7th. Yesterday Oct 5th one side stopped working. Today it's completely broken... nothing works on it anymore. I've got 4 kids and we have used all different kinds of headsets over the years... these lasted the shortest amount of time so far. Tried to contact the company thru Amazon and it just brings me to a link to download the user's manual.
