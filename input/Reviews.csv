"I've been using the G9000 headset for a few months now, and it's a solid choice for any gamer and works great for online meetings. First off, the sound quality is on point – I can hear every game detail, which ups my gaming experience. The bass surround is like being in the game! The mic is clear, and my friends hear me without any issues. It's also got this cool LED light that adds some style to my gaming setup. The only small downside is the plastic housing feels a bit cheap, but hey, it's a great deal for the price. In a nutshell, the G9000 is a winner for me."
"The only flaw I see with this headset is that the mic is a bit further away from the mouth than others I have used. I have been told it is difficult to hear me/sounds far away because of that. I adjusted my gaming settings and turned my mic volume up which helped, but have been told its still a bit faint. Everything else is 5 stars. Comfort, sound, etc. For the price, I am satisfied."
They worked gradually on my ps4 but then i got a PS5 and they keep unplugging and now they dont work. They also have a usb you plug in to turn on the LEDs but its so close to the controller and i cant even plug it in
"I'm not one to leave reviews, but this headset has exceeded expectations in every way. I just needed a new pair and didn't want to spend much money. I had zero expectation for noise cancellation, but can say that I'm using these for work and my co-workers can not hear any background noise while I'm using them, at all. Noises that have me on edge during a meeting (children, noise in the other room, dogs) go completely unnoticed by co-workers. I've asked... they don't hear it all.Very impressed by such an inexpensive headset. Definitely worth the money."
"It is easy to use, noise cancellation, I had it for about a year an ahalf still work great, you can mute it with a switch and it has volume control, it glows and it works great for Xbox series X or S or xbox one, I can hear footsteps before anyone else and they show how good they are at a value price. I would definitely buy them again"
"Other than the LED light plug in doesn't reach the gaming system, the gaming head phones works great."
"I've had this for almost a year now. There were some problems with the extension wire when I first got it, so I had to replace that. Besides that, these are really good headphones with good audio quality for it's price. I use them for gaming and music and they're more than sufficient, everything works well."
Light up plug-in cord is absurdly short. Literally no reason for this headset to have lighting if that’s the only way it operates.
"We bought these for our kids for Christmas, they have held up for several months. This definitely says something because they are the first ones to make it that long. They have said they work well, but my oldest is only 11. They are fun colors."
"Good headphones for the price, but they’re not great. A little clunky and you need to plug them into the USB port for them to light up. Again, worth the cheap price."
